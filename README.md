# Planning-School-Portfolio
Papers and projects from various courses and internships from my Masters of Urban Planning at NYU from 2022-24. Topics spanned statistics and economics to transit policy and law. Tools like R, STATA, Excel and QGIS were used to process data from the Census, ACS, the FTA, and various NYC agencies via the Open Data Portal.
